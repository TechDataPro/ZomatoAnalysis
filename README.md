# ZomatoAnalysis
 Overall, this project aims to uncover valuable insights about Zomato, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the platform's dynamics, customer preferences, and the factors that influence restaurant ratings.

First, I will clean the data and then start collecting and proccessing them. Secondly,  Let's find out the relation between online order and rating. 
Thirdly, Performing Unigram Analysis ## Performing Bi-gram / Trigram analysis on data. 
Finally, Extracting Geographical-coordinates from data ##Let's perform Spatial Analysis


As part of this project, I will undertake a comprehensive analysis of Zomato using the dataset I have previously collected and attached. The initial step involves meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data's integrity and reliability.

Subsequently, we will explore the intriguing relationship between online orders and ratings, unearthing any potential correlations or patterns that may exist and examining their influence on restaurant ratings.


Furthermore, we will delve into the realm of textual analysis by performing Unigram, Bi-gram, and Trigram analysis on the data. This approach will provide deeper insights into the language and phrases used in customer reviews, enriching our understanding of the factors that contribute to restaurant ratings.


In addition to textual analysis, we will extract geographical coordinates from the data. This geographical information will enable us to perform spatial analysis, unveiling spatial patterns, and distributions of restaurants across different areas.


Overall, this project aims to uncover valuable insights about Zomato, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the platform's dynamics, customer preferences, and the factors that influence restaurant ratings.
